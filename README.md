# :gear: streamlit-utils

In this repository I will collect some useful wrappers for streamlit that I
regularly use for my own projects. You can get a demonstration of each
wrapper by running the `app.py` file with streamlit.


Step 1: Clone this repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:mwinterde/streamlit-utils.git
```

Step 2: Install the dependencies.

```
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 3: Run the app.

```
streamlit run app.py
```

Step 4: Explore.

* Open http://localhost:8501 to interact with the streamlit app.
